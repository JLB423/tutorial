Clone repo to local machine –

Add and commit files to github – 
•	Make any changes to your files
•	Then in the terminal type: git add
•	Then: git status – this will show what files have been changed and are ready to be committed
•	Then type: git commit –m “type your message here’   # need to have a message to commit , you can also add another –m which will be for the description box (the first –m is just for the title)
